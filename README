Board Setup

Lubang Menggali Rules
====================

Game Play
=========
The player who begins with the first move picks up all the stones in anyone of
his own six pits, and sows the stones on to the right, one in each of the following
pits, including his own Lubang Menggali. No stones are put in the opponents'
Lubang Menggali. If the player's last stone lands in his own Lubang Menggali,
he gets another turn. This can be repeated several times before it's the other
player's turn.

Capturing Stones
================
During the game the pits are emptied on both sides. Always when the last stone
lands in an own empty pit, the player captures his own stone and all stones in the
opposite pit (the other players' pit) and puts them in his own Lubang Menggali.

The Game Ends
=============
The game is over as soon as one of the sides run out of stones. The player
who still has stones in his pits keeps them and puts them in his/hers Lubang
Menggali. Winner of the game is the player who has the most stones in
his Lubang Menggali.
